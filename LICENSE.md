Hello world, I love to talk about Aliens... How I believe they've been here on 🌎 way before US!!!! I've been fascinated and mind blown thinking or talking about them. We have been an experiment for them I believe because, they are our Makers. 
You can him and hah over it. They probably make bets on who will develop this, or whom starts a war, or who made the most money this year. Just anything you can think of, we all are a JOKE. I can be VERY right or VERY wrong. I believe in many things and I feel very strongly about it. I've had nothing but time on my hands, so yes I've watched many movies on 👽👾 aliens. I have wondered how much of it's true. The movie or movies are preparing US for the moment the Aliens show themselves. Think about it 🧐 makes sense to me. Maybe 🤔 I'm just CRAZY 🤣. Maybe 🤔 I'm not CRAZY!!!!? MOVIES are showing us how to communicate, how to present ourselves, also, how to survive survival. Survival is the key to moving forward to communicating become richer with the knowledge of what we already know and knowledge of what we can learn from the aliens. I strongly believe that we have never been alone that we are here for a reason. That reason is to create to be rich in knowledge. Knowledge is key to survival and being rich beyond our dreams. Or, we are here for other reasons and I'm just crazy I don't know you don't know but it is a thought and that is my thought all the time movies are teaching us to survive how to move forward how we've destroyed our Earth and need to get back to the bare necessities and that there's always a big brother watching over us think about that
